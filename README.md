# Currency Converter

This is a terminal-based currency converter project built with **Python**, **Selenium**, and **NumPy**.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Selenium
- NumPy

## 📋 Description

- The application runs directly in the terminal (no GUI at the moment).
- Asks the user to enter an amount.
- Then it asks which currency to convert to (e.g., USD to EUR).
- It fetches real-time exchange rates from Google using Selenium.
- Finally, it prints the converted amount in the terminal.
- This is a sample project; it has no commercial purpose. I'm also working on other projects.
